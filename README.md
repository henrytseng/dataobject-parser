DataObject Parser
=================

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/henrytseng/dataobject-parser/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/henrytseng/dataobject-parser/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

A nodejs module designed to parse an Object hash transposing between dot-notation and a structured heirarchy of Objects/Arrays.  


## TL;DR

String programming should be avoided.  

This module generally exists as a quick work around.  We original developed it to store our [MongoDb](http://www.mongodb.org/) documents in [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) models.  Our Backbonejs.model dispatched events from data in a complex hierarchal structure.  

Using this tool simplified our models so that we could just use one model with the subdocuments laid out in a hash with dot-notation.  In our application we've overwritten the Backbonejs.sync to parse the data before sending/receiving.  


## Installation

	$ npm install dataobject-parser

## Quick Start

Instantiate a new instance of DataObjectParser to manage an object:

	var d = new DataObjectParser();


Set using dot-notation:

	d.set("caravan.personel.leader","Travis");
	d.set("caravan.personel.cook","Brent");

Also set using array notation:

	d.set("location.rooms[0]", "kitchen");
	d.set("location.rooms[1]", "bathroom");

The Object returned should be the equivalent structured object:

	var obj = d.data();

That is, where `obj` is equivalent to:

	var obj = {
		caravan:{
			personel:{
				leader: "Travis",
				cook: "Brent"
			}
		},
		location: {
			rooms: ["kitchen", "bathroom"]
		}
	};

`transpose()` and `untranspose()` methods can transform the data between the two formats (e.g. - An Object hash with properties using dot-notation and a heirchy structured Object or Object(s)/Arrays(s))

	flat = DataObjectParser.untranspose(structured)

	structured = DataObjectParser.transpose(flat)

Where the equivalent results would be:

	var structured = {
		location: {
			city:{
				name: "House on cliff",
				geo: '45, 23'
			}
		},
		time: {
			hour: '0',
			minute: '0'
		},
		duration: '4 hours',
		record: 'Beetles'
	};

	var flat = {
		'location.city.name': 'House on cliff',
		'location.city.geo': '45, 23',
		'time.hour': '0',
		'time.minute': '0',
		duration: '4 hours',
		record: 'Beetles'
	};

Please take a look at the test: `test/utils-dataobject-parser.js` for more code examples.
